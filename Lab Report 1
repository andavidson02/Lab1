In the code that I made today, it eventually made the led responsive and follow the controls of the button on the lauchpad. In the beginning of the code I defined what everything was that I will be using. Then I started to code the input. The red LED should start out clear. I then made the button a resistor which will activate the output. Then when coding the output I sync the button to the led light so if the button is pressed the light is on then when it is pressed agian it activates it because of the not symbol in the input at the beginning switches the 1 to a 0 which turns it off.
